  Steam Chain is a puzzle platformer that tried to mix both worlds in a seamless fashion. Whether it succeeded
  or not is up to you to decide, but the game uses gears that not only can be used to propel the character
  throughout the level, but can also be integrated into logic puzzles that involve torque and positive/negative
  rotation. The game also features a steampunk aesthetic, which influenced some design decisions, or vice-versa
  now that I think about it. It has been a minute.

  Being the first proper game project for everyone in the team, it came with its set of challenges, mostly, on
  the communication and team building side. We were divided into project manager/game designer, programmer, and
  artist, and while the train chugged along without any major catastrophes, not everything went smoothly. Being
  the appointed PM/GD, I tried to do my best to keep the whole thing in a cohesive state, but some concessions
  had to be done regarding the art side of things, and midway through I had to pick the programming gig.

  While the core of the game was always the interaction between the platforming elements and the puzzle
  sections, our programmer was having a hard time and seriously considering abandoning the puzzle
  implementation, so I ended up tackling that front. Design wise, I think it turned out alright, at least in
  terms of level design. I tried to adjust the jump arc with the tools I was given, but the end result still
  turned out floaty. Overall, for first proper project, I think it was ok, specially taking into account that
  everyone involved had picked up some necessary skills like coding mere months before.
