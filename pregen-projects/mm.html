<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Metallic Mayhem is a twin-stick shooter focused on arcade action, while being easily accessible to everyone
  who picks up a controller (or a mobile device). While the game keeps it pretty traditional, the main draw
  comes from the ability to join seamlessly an ongoing match by scanning a displayed QR code with a mobile
  device, getting into the action without downloading any app or other boring/time-consuming bloatware. PS: a
  web page displays the controls on mobile, as there is no such thing as black magic after all.

  Having the project a bit of development work already put into place, I was brought into it in order to try and
  add some more mechanical depth over the already established foundation. Like any good person would have done,
  that mission translated into implementing a dodge roll and a charge shot mechanic, designing, balancing,
  and creating some assets required for both to work as well.

  Since I was already around the office though, I then tackled the rework of the game's powerup system,
  converting it from a Smash TV type affair into something akin to
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_2" target="_blank">ROR2</a>
  or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)" target="_blank">TBOI</a>, in
  order to further boost the skill ceiling and versatility of gameplay. Lastly, making part of the team meant
  contributing to the usual Scrum ceremonies, PR handling, and even developing some proofs of concept, like
  Twitch integration, for example.
