<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Anemoia Damacy is an action-adventure game starring a cat/dog duo trying to find an assortment of trinkets for
  their owner. Focused on the general ambiance and aesthetic, the game tries to present itself in a relaxed and
  nostalgic manner, while keeping the gameplay simple but dynamic. Part of the dynamism comes from the two
  characters that need to be controlled simultaneously, either through a single controller using both analog
  sticks, or by two players working together. Each character has an alternate form with different abilities in
  order to overcome obstacles and progress further.

  Contrary to most other projects, a couple of my responsibilities this time around were surrounding the art
  assets of the game, which, mind you, didn't mean I was responsible for the general art direction. Curiously,
  by the hand of fate I assume, the art team aboard this project did not have much experience regarding game
  development, nor 3D asset production, so while the character designs were done by our dedicated artist,
  for example, I was mostly occupied with the modelling and animating of said characters. Since I was already
  dealing with animations, their implementation along with the rest of the character's behaviour was also
  handled by me.

  While once again I ended up tackling the so called 3C's, as well as general gameplay programming, not
  everything went smoothly on this front, mostly concerning the collision based interactions in general. While
  maybe a fundamentally different approach should have been taken regarding the use of collisions, design wise
  it was decided that pushable objects should be interacted with seamlessly, which made it trickier to
  transition the character from some other states to the push state. Even if the character interaction on this
  front could use some more work, the collision of the pushable objects with the world geometry were still
  the source of some major problems. Other than that, I handled everything audio related.
