  Beet Up is a short action based arcade style game, with the single objective of getting the highest score
  possible depending on how long the player manages to survive. As more enemies come from outer space, the task
  of protecting the centre of the screen gets harder, forcing the player to manage the currency acquired
  throughout play in order to progress through several powerup trees. Eventually the enemies become
  unmanageable, leaving the player with only their highscore to contemplate.

  Being developed for the 2023's edition of Global Game Jam, with the theme "Roots", the team spent quite a
  while brainstorming an idea, after which tasks were delegated to different members. Taking into account the
  theme and the concept of protecting a core from enemies burrowing underground, this idea of managing what has
  already been burrowed vs what hasn't, had to be represented to the player in some way, which became my
  responsibility throughout the jam, only managing to crack the approach well into the 48 hour time limit.

  Since Godot lacked any such feature out of the box, the R&D process consisted of checking what had been done
  regarding such feature, and hacking way a solution that worked for us based on other people's efforts. This
  resulted in a collider associated with a sprite, that on collision with the enemies, recalculates itself on
  given time intervals, based on a boolean operation that takes into account the enemy's collider. Other than
  that, general bug fixing is always on the menu in these types of projects, with the game coming together
  pretty neatly in the last couple of hours.
