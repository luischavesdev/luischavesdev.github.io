<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Point of View is a 3rd person shooter that pits players in a 1v1 online arena, where each has to outsmart the
  opponent by using the colours of the environment. By having flat colours applied to everything, even the player
  characters, it becomes virtually impossible to identify the enemy if its backdrop is of the same colour, which
  can be accomplished since players can switch the colour of their character. Having to navigate through sounds
  and missed shots, the only extra thing players need is a Steam account, since the game relies on their online
  subsystem API.

  Created during 2021's edition of Global Game Jam under the theme "Lost and Found", the initial idea that was
  pitched was an action-adventure where the player had to navigate a world with flat colours, making some objects
  only visible under a certain perspective. To ease on the game design and also experiment with online
  multiplayer, the team pivoted to an online shooter using the same concept, with a single team member assigned
  to figuring out all the network intricacies. This left the other programmers to focus on gameplay mechanics,
  such as aim, player interaction, and general game state.

  At the end of the jam, we ended up having the game kinda working well enough to transmit the general concept,
  but it was sort of hanging by a thread and relatively unstable. Over the next week or so, me and another team
  member picked up all the network code and reworked it, giving some extra polish to gameplay mechanics to boot.
  While giving some final touches like UI and sound, development time went over a week, so the 2 day time period
  falsely advertised at the top is a blatant lie. Sue me!
