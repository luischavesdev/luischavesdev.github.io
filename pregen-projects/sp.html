  With Sound Particles having already work done on the binaural front, the next step was to expand the immersive
  audio experience by having the ability to pan binaural audio based on the position of the listener's head. In
  order to do this, integration of some kind of tracking had to be done, and in between several options, like
  camera-based tracking, the chosen option ended up being an IMU based solution, either integrated into the
  headphones, like in Apple's AirPods, or through an external Bluetooth device.

  Being brought into the team with the task of R&D'ing possible solutions for the problem at hand, the first
  approach consisted in trying to retrieve the IMU's information from the AirPods, since they were the first
  thing at hand at the office. After a couple of days researching the topic, a Swift app was put together that
  could receive the angles information, but this could be done only by using a proprietary API only available in
  iOS, which kinda limited the reach of the final product. Shortly after, work started to be done on the Waves'
  NX, which worked through Bluetooth.

  Regarding the NX, the communication protocol used to communicate with Waves' apps was figured out, allowing
  the IMU's information to be accessed by a generic API created in C++ for better integration with Sound
  Particles codebase. Work was also done with Supperware's tracker, which had open documentation, but
  communicated through MIDI, forcing the C++ API to abstract the idiosyncrasies of each head-tracker. Finally,
  the work done was integrated in a JUCE project, further developed so the angle information could be sent using
  OSC, and just for good measure, Allan Deviation and other performance indicators were measured across the 3
  solutions with the help of Max/MSP, and we concluded that Supperware's solution was the best fit overall.
