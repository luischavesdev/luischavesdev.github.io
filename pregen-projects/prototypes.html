<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Several game prototypes were developed in order to get oneself familiarized with Unreal's flavour of C++,
  including a mini, footsies only, fighting game, as well as a stripped down, online, Unreal Tournament like, in
  order to also get some experience regarding network programming. Both projects get more or less close to
  reaching the double digit Gigs tier, even after being compressed, so in case someone wants to try them out and
  give them a spin, do send me an email, or contact me directly through some other channel.

  As part of an optional class focused on exploring what could be done in Unreal by using C++, as well as the
  usual workflow of things when going through that route, at least two bite-sized projects were developed, them
  being a proto fighting game, and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_Tournament" target="_blank">UT</a>
  inspired mini online shooter. The fighting game was mostly developed by myself, and
  features only a light/medium/heavy punch, a short 3-hit auto combo, and a primitive jump, with the rest being
  left to good old fundamentals. Also, it's always important to mention the usual disclaimer that most assets,
  just like in the other project, were "borrowed" as needed, since they were not the focus.

  The FPS was developed in a group of 2, and besides getting some C++ practice in, we also did the usual Steam
  subsystem API setup, which was substantially trickier to get around using C++ than by using only
  Blueprints. Nonetheless, it was good practice, and it was something that otherwise we wouldn't have done,
  since blueprints are much more practical to prototype a couple of gameplay ideas than jumping straight into
  C++, especially when one isn't 100% comfortable with the workflow. Case in point, most implementation work done
  in these prototypes was first developed using blueprints, and then translated into C++.
