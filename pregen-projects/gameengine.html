<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Project made with a friend not only to further explore C++ development, but also game engine
  architecture in general. The main project consists of a 2D game engine with a similar class structure to
  Unreal, already offering the concepts of actor, pawn, character, etc... Naturally not everything was built
  from scratch though, as the render pipeline was developed on top of OpenGL, and SDL was used for window
  creation, input handling, and audio. Collisions are also abstracted, but under the hood run based on Box2D.
  As a proof of concept, a mock shmup using free assets was created using the already compiled engine as an
  external library.

  As a small duo project, it's easy enough for one to keep a holistic vision of the project along its
  development, but even then, some aspects end up falling more into one's plate. Personally, collision handling
  as well as input handling were aspects mostly developed by myself, while the graphics pipeline was set into
  stone by my other teammate, leaving me space to focus more on the OpenGL integration. Audio for example also
  fell outside of my responsibility, and core design elements like the architecture of the engine was decided by
  us both.

  On the game's side, matters were also split between us two, with me being responsible for the enemies and
  setting aside the player spaceship for example. That said, the "game" portion was simply put into place so we
  could make sure whatever feature we implemented was actually working as intended. All in all, the end result
  turned out pretty neat, with only some form of font parsing lacking from the final version, leaving the game
  with its score to be displayed on the console. It's no biggie though, just one more thing for the eternal and
  ever-growing TODO list of project tweaks.
