<h6>Description</h6>
<p>
  Yellow Sky attempted to be a 4X-ish game with some RPG-ish elements, which in practice led to a game where the
  player is plopped into a proc-gen apocalyptic wasteland, peppered with villages and abandoned factories. The
  only way to progress is by trying to restore the environment's state, which would ideally affect the ending.
  To keep the villages alive, the factories need to be managed such that enough resources are generated to keep
  the network of villages thriving. Keeping the villages around unlocks quests that reveal more about the world.

<h6>Contribution</h6>
<p>
  Having to develop a game in 2D and under the "help the environment" theme, we quickly landed on the 4X type
  gameplay. What remained uncertain for most of the project's development were the actual core features that had
  to be implemented, with at times having a development year's worth of ideas. Nonetheless, work was delegated
  throughout the members, and on my plate I ended up with the responsibility to figure out and implement
  everything concerning the settlements present in the game. The standout from that process was probably the
  bartering screen, allowing the player to trade items from its inventory with items owned by a given
  settlement.

  In general, work mostly revolved around dealing with the data structures inherent to the settlements, as well
  as the necessary UI that could communicate that information to the player. Other than, several hats were worn,
  having helped around the project as needed, mostly regarding code related matters, but also on some quest
  writing for example. Balancing the game also became my responsability, but having only finished implementing
  core mechanics a couple days before the deadline due to scope creep, and having zero experience balancing
  something of the sort, led me to do research on the topic, but barely getting my feet wet in terms of actual
  adjusting values in-game.
