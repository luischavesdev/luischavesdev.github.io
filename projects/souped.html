       Description
      </h6>
      <p>
       In Get Souped! you play as a "Godzilla-like" in a quest to make the best soup possible. Turns out though, that
  the main ingredient is a type of tiny creature that lives in a crowded city being ravaged by a contagious
  disease. Moving around the map, the player needs to guide creatures into the soup while avoiding the
  contamination by the infected, while also using the ability to stomp buildings, not only to spawn more
  creatures, but also kill any unneeded ones.

      <p>
       Developed around the theme "Tiny Creatures" associated with the 56th edition of Ludum Dare, the team started
  by pitching around some ideas, and based on the chaotic nature of entity management that was achieved in
       <a href="bonzios.html" target="_blank">
        Bonzios
       </a>
       we came up with the idea of turning those entities into tiny
  creatures that have some autonomy and move around freely. The contextualization by using a Godzilla-like
  figure then came naturally, and somehow the culinary theme also got thrown into the mix somehow. Regarding
  actual development, the first task that was assigned to me was figuring out how we were going to mix
  the 3D buildings while keeping the classic 2D Godot engine workflow intact.

      <p>
       This mix ended up being accomplished by having a second camera rendering a 3D scene on the side - with all the
  corresponding buildings - and then using a texture overlayed on top of the 2D camera working as a render
  target for the 3D camera. Keeping both cameras in sync, as well as any other camera behaviour, like
  camera-shake for example, was also handled by me. Other than that, I also ended up being responsible for level
  design, putting the city together, but also behaviour related to the destruction of said city, from the
  buildings to the actual stomp that the player can perform.
