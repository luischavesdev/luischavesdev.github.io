        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Onis is a symmetrical multiplayer turn-based strategy game. Unlike its descriptive nomenclature though, the
          game is pretty simple. Being centred around a cube that is composed of several tiles, the game has each
          player outmanoeuvre each other in order to grab an opposing crown, and successfully bring it to its base, in a
          capture the flag fashion. Sprinkled with a couple powerups, the game offers a pretty solid base which could be
          further built upon.

        <h6>Contribution</h6>
        <p>
          Being the sole developer on the project, whatever feature was deemed implementable or not, depended on me.
          Luckily, development went pretty smoothly, with the core idea of the game being established in the early
          phases, along with the development of the tile system as well as the so called 3C's. A bit of time was
          expended in these issues since having the game board being set along a cube posed a couple of puzzling
          questions, like controlling the cube vs the camera, how the game reacts to edge cases like... character
          movement along the edge of the cube, for example.

        <p>
          Since this was also the team's first 3D game, I tried to push for the best possible usage of the extra
          dimension, hence the use of a cube for the board, as well as the main menu. Other hardships were left
          unattended though. The "cube world" was supposed to feel more organic, with events like geysers appearing
          throughout the game and affecting several faces at the same time. Some of these aspects would require a
          multidisciplinary effort, while others, like making the tiles float on the water instead of just being
          suspended, were mostly unsolved problems on my end.
