        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Bonzios is a time-attack game where the player is tasked with keeping a computer alive while a virus runs
          rampant spewing all sorts of garbled and nefarious files. In order to keep the OS from crashing due to lack of
          space, the good files must be sorted from the malign, which sometimes involves running them through an
          antivirus. While the player's doom is inevitable, a couple of limited powerups are available along the way,
          helping to navigate the once usual GUI based OS interface.

          Developed for Ludum Dare 54 surrounding the theme "Limited Space", after bouncing around several ideas, we
          landed on the so familiar limited HDD space problem. Focusing early on on the idea and pretended scope, we
          quickly started to prototype core mechanics like the box selection and draggable files/windows. With a myriad
          of amusing interactions one could design revolving around UX shenanigans, I mostly focused on a couple of
          them, like windows that follow the mouse around, installers that trick the player into clicking "Next", so on
          and so forth.

        <p>
          Having finished the jam with a mostly concise project, some things still ended up on the cutting room floor,
          which, who knows, may have been a blessing in disguise. For example, the final game did not involve any
          managing specific to "good" files, which could have been taken into account for the final score. Folders and
          similar containers were also not implemented, which could make the player peruse through a compressed file,
          for example, to check if it had any file worth saving, thus extracting and sorting all the remaining worthless
          ones.
