        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Anemoia Damacy is an action-adventure game starring a cat/dog duo trying to find an assortment of trinkets for
          their owner. Focused on the general ambiance and aesthetic, the game tries to present itself in a relaxed and
          nostalgic manner, while keeping the gameplay simple but dynamic. Part of the dynamism comes from the two
          characters that need to be controlled simultaneously, either through a single controller using both analog
          sticks, or by two players working together. Each character has an alternate form with different abilities in
          order to overcome obstacles and progress further.

        <h6>Contribution</h6>
        <p>
          Contrary to most other projects, a couple of my responsibilities this time around were surrounding the art
          assets of the game, which, mind you, didn't mean I was responsible for the general art direction. Curiously,
          by the hand of fate I assume, the art team aboard this project did not have much experience regarding game
          development, nor 3D asset production, so while the character designs were done by our dedicated artist,
          for example, I was mostly occupied with the modelling and animating of said characters. Since I was already
          dealing with animations, their implementation along with the rest of the character's behaviour was also
          handled by me.

        <p>
          While once again I ended up tackling the so called 3C's, as well as general gameplay programming, not
          everything went smoothly on this front, mostly concerning the collision based interactions in general. While
          maybe a fundamentally different approach should have been taken regarding the use of collisions, design wise
          it was decided that pushable objects should be interacted with seamlessly, which made it trickier to
          transition the character from some other states to the push state. Even if the character interaction on this
          front could use some more work, the collision of the pushable objects with the world geometry were still
          the source of some major problems. Other than that, I handled everything audio related.
