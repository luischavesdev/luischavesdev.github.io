        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Null Gravity is a short and simple platformer that has a gravity disabling mechanic as its main draw. You play
          as an astronaut stranded on a space station, having to escape in a given time limit, and in order to help you,
          the station's artificial gravity can be toggled on and off. This makes it so that platforming needs to be
          approached in a slightly different way, taking into account that all the momentum the character has gets
          preserved when the gravity is disabled.

        <h6>Contribution</h6>
        <p>
          Being not only the first jam project for most people involved, but also the first game-like project in a team,
          a lot of it was discovered as we went. The Global Game Jam theme of "Repair" was just used as a backdrop, and
          since the team was mostly comfortable doing platformer like projects, we picked the same route just to be
          sure. Even then, the concept of being able to disable gravity is relatively interesting and provided itself to
          a couple of curious designs on some levels. In that sense, the initial team division had me dealing with
          level design, coupled with adjusting the character's jump arc and overall movement.

          Midway through, help was needed on the programming side, so I helped with some enemy logic, as well as level
          transitions. Overall, taking into account the inexperience of everyone involved, the project turned out pretty
          alright, especially when we also take into account that it was everyone's first game jam. Some level ideas
          ended up being scrapped, and the music production found some hiccups along the way, but some casualties are
          always to be expected in these types of ordeals.
