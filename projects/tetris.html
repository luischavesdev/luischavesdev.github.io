        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Tetris implementation built using Kotlin, with a couple of added features just for good measure. Besides the
          standard Tetris gameplay, the project also has a customizable profile section, along with an online
          leaderboard that keeps track of player's highest scores. Regarding the actual gameplay of Tetris, only the
          most fundamental mechanics were implemented, so no T-Spins, no wall kicks, no hard drops, etc.

        <p>
          Project developed for a mobile development class by three experienced developers. Tongue twisters apart
          though, being a class project, some requirements had to be implemented, like the usual use of hardware
          features, GPS location, database connection, and so forth. As to how to contextualize those features, the
          team's go-to approach was always to wrap them in a game, so this time around we chose Tetris as a classic
          baseline to follow, presenting a sweet middle ground when it comes to implementation difficulty. With the
          workload being split between us three, I got the Tetris part, which mostly consisted in creating the different
          tetrominoes data structures and rendering them to the screen.

        <p>
          Other than that, several game logic considerations had to be made, like how to handle line clears, which
          implied splitting the different pieces into individual blocks, that in turn were managed on a grid system. In
          terms of communication with the rest of the app, the final score is stored at the end of each game, and gets
          placed on the leaderboard using Firebase, in case the value consists of an highscore. On the leaderboard,
          associated with each highscore is the player's profile pic as well as it's country, assuming the player
          allowed the location settings to be turned on.
