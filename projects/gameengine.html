        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Project made with a friend not only to further explore C++ development, but also game engine
          architecture in general. The main project consists of a 2D game engine with a similar class structure to
          Unreal, already offering the concepts of actor, pawn, character, etc... Naturally not everything was built
          from scratch though, as the render pipeline was developed on top of OpenGL, and SDL was used for window
          creation, input handling, and audio. Collisions are also abstracted, but under the hood run based on Box2D.
          As a proof of concept, a mock shmup using free assets was created using the already compiled engine as an
          external library.

        <p>
          As a small duo project, it's easy enough for one to keep a holistic vision of the project along its
          development, but even then, some aspects end up falling more into one's plate. Personally, collision handling
          as well as input handling were aspects mostly developed by myself, while the graphics pipeline was set into
          stone by my other teammate, leaving me space to focus more on the OpenGL integration. Audio for example also
          fell outside of my responsibility, and core design elements like the architecture of the engine was decided by
          us both.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the game's side, matters were also split between us two, with me being responsible for the enemies and
          setting aside the player spaceship for example. That said, the "game" portion was simply put into place so we
          could make sure whatever feature we implemented was actually working as intended. All in all, the end result
          turned out pretty neat, with only some form of font parsing lacking from the final version, leaving the game
          with its score to be displayed on the console. It's no biggie though, just one more thing for the eternal and
          ever-growing TODO list of project tweaks.
