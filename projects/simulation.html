        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
          Simulation Simulator is the name we gave to a project meant to demo out some CG concepts as well as Panda3D as
          an engine itself. It consists of a 2D section and a 3D section, both tackling features appropriate to each
          situation. The 2D section showcases ambient light vs complex light, as well as orthographic cameras vs
          perspective cameras, for example, while the 3D scene includes complex PBR materials. Needless to say, 3D and
          audio asset creation were not the focus here.

        <h6>Contribution</h6>
        <p>
          Made under the suggestion of a CG's teacher to use Panda3D to demo out some concepts that were introduced in
          class, we came up with the concept of making a small interactive experience that would start out rendered as
          wireframe through an orthographic camera, and that would then progressively build up to be more complex,
          revealing that the initial scene was just a 2D game in a screen. While the initial idea remained until the
          end, the smooth transition between scenes ended up being a hard one between literal scene objects in Panda3D.

        <p>
          Some constraints and difficulties were mainly due to the somewhat inaccessibility of Panda3D, having resources
          that most often than not come from the 2000's, but also the inexperience of some members with a 3D asset
          pipeline, resulting in overblown meshes with disproportionate polycounts, that would end up affecting the
          game's performance. Then again, maybe the issue was on us misusing Panda3D, and not the inability of the
          engine itself to keep up. I guess we'll never know...

          <li>Done to demo some CG concepts like lighting and shading.</li>
          <li>Consists of a "2D section" and 3D section.</li>
          <li>All creative work was "outsourced", i.e. we grabbed the audio and assets that we could.</li>
          <li>Was responsible for the 2D portion of the project.</li>
