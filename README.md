# Personal Portfolio
<p align="justify">
  Custom webpage meant to work as a personal portfolio, aiming for a straightfoward approach without too much fluff in the way, and 3rd party stuff kept to a minimum. You should be able to manage with the <code>index.html</code>, css file, and javascript files alone, but in case you're up for it, a python script can be used to generate the final html file based on neatly arranged information. If you buy into the static site generation pipeline, do remember to run the generator after any change/before deploying it.

  If you feel like you've seen a similar design/layout before, it is very well possible, since this has to be at least a 3rd order frankenstein of a job, tailored to what I wanted to showcase. In case you like some aspect of the whole package but want to adjust something else to your needs, feel free to clone it and go wild. Credit is appreciated but not needed. If you're looking for a way to host the webpage, you can also use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> like I did.
