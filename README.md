# Personal Portfolio
<p align="justify">
  Custom webpage meant to work as a personal portfolio, aiming for a straightfoward approach without too much fluff in the way. Everything you need is in the html, css and javascript files, with 3rd party stuff kept to a 
  minimum. If you feel like you've seen a similar design/layout before, it is very well possible, since this has to be at least a 3rd order frankenstein of a job, tailored to what I wanted to showcase. In case you like   
  some aspect of the whole package but want to adjust something else to your needs, feel free to clone it and go wild. If you're looking for a way to host the webpage, you can also use 
  <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> like I did.
